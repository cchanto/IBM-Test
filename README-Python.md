The improvedCountUniques function takes a different approach. It uses a dictionary to keep track of unique numbers. In Python, dictionary keys are unique, so we can take advantage of this property to efficiently track unique elements.

Here's how the improvedCountUniques function works:

We initialize an empty dictionary unique_nums.

We iterate over the input list nums.

For each element num, we use it as the key in the dictionary. The value associated with the key doesn't matter in this case, so we set it to True.

Since dictionary keys are unique, if we encounter the same num again, it will overwrite the previous entry in the dictionary, effectively eliminating duplicates.

After processing all elements in nums, the length of the dictionary (len(unique_nums)) will give us the count of unique elements.

This approach can be more efficient than using a set in cases where the overhead of creating a set (which involves hashing and potentially resizing the set) is more expensive than simply inserting elements into a dictionary.

Overall, the improvedCountUniques function provides a potentially more efficient way to count unique elements, depending on the characteristics of the input data.
